The project is in a very early, foundational stage. It has transitioned from a simple "Hello World" template to the bare-bones skeleton of a sophisticated monitoring application. The core architectural components you described have been initiated (specifically the AccessibilityService), but none of the actual logic is implemented.1. UI (User Interface)•Current State:

 The UI is still the default Jetpack Compose template, displaying a simple "Hello Android!" text. There is no user-facing interface for the monitoring features, nor is there a way for a user to enable the required services.
 
 •Shortcomings: For the app to be usable, you will need to build screens to:◦Clearly explain to the user why you need AccessibilityService and other permissions.◦Provide a button or guide to take the user directly to the system settings to enable the service.◦Display the status of the monitoring service (e.g., "Active," "Disabled").◦(As per your plan) Provide privacy controls for the user.
 2.  Functionality•Current State: The only "functionality" is displaying the initial screen. I have added the MonitoringService.kt file and registered it in the AndroidManifest.xml along with its configuration file. However, the service itself is a placeholder and contains no monitoring logic in the onAccessibilityEvent method.•Shortcomings: All the core features you outlined are completely missing. This includes:◦App activity monitoring.◦Notification capture.◦SMS/MMS observation.◦ML model integration and inference.◦ZKP proof generation.
 
 3. Production Readiness•Current State: The project is not remotely close to production-ready. It is a prototype at the file-creation stage.•Architecture: We have created a services package, which is a good first step. However, the planned MVVM + Clean Architecture (Domain, Data, Presentation layers), Dependency Injection, and repositories do not exist yet. The code is not separated by concern.•Testing: There is no testing infrastructure. No unit tests for logic (of which there is none yet) and no instrumented tests for the UI or services.•Security & Privacy: This is the biggest concern. While you have a solid plan with on-device ML, ZKP, and encrypted storage, none of it is implemented. The current AccessibilityService is configured to receive all event types (typeAllMask), which is a major red flag for privacy and for Google Play Store review. In a production app, you would need to scope this down to the absolute minimum event types required.•Battery Optimization: The WorkManager, JobScheduler, and Doze mode handling you planned are not implemented. A constantly running service without careful optimization will quickly drain the user's battery.SummaryThink of the project as a construction site. We have surveyed the land and put up the first piece of framing for a very complex skyscraper. The foundation is barely laid.To move forward, you will need to build out every single functional component you described in your plan. The current code serves only as the entry point for the AccessibilityService that you will need to build upon.
